### Golden Gate Park
- Big park with botanical garden, Japanese tea garden, and place to boat. Don't come here at night. Homeless people live here at night.

### Cable Car
- Ride down the hill and watch the view. It's like roller coaster, except it doesn't go very fast.

### Sightseeing
- I remember you saying sightseeing's boring. But there are ways to make it fun by driving a mini-car or go on a segway city tour.
